## Starter command

```bash
mycli --help
mycli hello
mycli hello <name>
mycli --version
```

Replace these commands with behavior specific to your project.

## Go development

```bash
make fmt
make test
make vet
make lint
make check
make build
make build-all
make install-local
make clean
```

## Project bootstrap and release

```bash
make bootstrap BOOTSTRAP_ARGS='--cli-name pluck --github-owner acme --github-repo pluck'
make check
make docs-check
make docs-build
# edit docs/src/content/docs/changelog.md, then commit and push it
make release-tag VERSION=0.2.0
```

The bootstrap target updates the repeated project identity fields from the
repository root. Releases are triggered by pushing a `v*` tag after the
changelog has been edited and committed. GitHub Actions handles the release
assets and npm publication.

## Docs development

```bash
make docs-install
make docs-dev
make docs-check
make docs-build
make docs-preview
```

## Main files

```bash
cmd/mycli/main.go             # CLI entrypoint
internal/app/app.go           # command parser and handlers
internal/app/app_test.go      # starter tests
internal/buildinfo/buildinfo.go # version plumbing

```
